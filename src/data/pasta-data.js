    about:
      "Pinot noir is known for its rich, earthy undertones. The deepness of the tones in the wine makes a perfect partner for tomato-based pasta dishes, like a classic marinara with meatballs or a hearty tomato sauce with sausage. A very versatile wine, pinot noir also pairs perfectly with traditional pesto sauces. A more fruity pinot lends itself well to pairing with a creamy sauce.",

    about:
      "A lighter red wine, Reisling may not seem to be able to stand up to a rich dish, but it does pair well with the main meal. A mushroom-based sauce brings out the notes of pear and peach, while floral undertones will accompany a spicy puttanesca sauce. Reisling is on the sweeter end of wines, so aim for warm, rich, creamy sauces. For protein, choose pork or chicken.",

      "One of the most famous wines globally, a good Cabernet Sauvignon is an incredibly versatile wine that goes with most dishes. Because there are so many varieties of the wine, you’ll want to be selective of the overtones and subtle notes. Primarily, a Cabernet Sauvignon will feature a warm, spiced flavor reminiscent of coffee, cedar, black currant, and vanilla. Some varieties will feature a robust stone-fruit undertone. A high-tannin wine, Cabernet Sauvignon has a bit of bitterness that is cut perfectly when paired with a tangy tomato sauce. Try a creamy tomato sauce for an exciting alternative to traditional marinara or Bolognese.",

    price: 60,
    about:
      "A deep red wine, Zinfandel is similar to Cabernet Sauvignon in that it is a high tannin content. This adds a touch of acidity and bitterness that, when combined with the wine’s spicy undertones, makes it the perfect companion to virtually any Italian pasta dish. Tomato-based sauces are favored, but you can even opt for creamy sauces without disrupting the flavor profile for a lighter version of a Zinfandel.",
